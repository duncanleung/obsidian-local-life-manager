## Research Framework

When researching a market, systematically investigate these areas:

### 1. Competitive Landscape Mapping

**Direct Competitors**
- Who are the direct competitors solving the same problem?
- What's their positioning and unique value proposition?
- Who are their target customers?
- What's their pricing model and price points?
- How long have they been around? Funding/revenue?
- What do users love/hate about them? (check G2, Capterra, Reddit, HN)

**Indirect Competitors**
- What alternative solutions exist? (different approach, same outcome)
- What's the "do nothing" or manual alternative?
- What adjacent products are customers using as workarounds?

**Failed Competitors**
- Who tried this before and failed? Why?
- What can we learn from their mistakes?
- What's different now that might make it work?

### 2. Market Structure & Dynamics

**Market Size & Growth**
- TAM/SAM/SOM with sources and methodology
- Market growth rate and trends
- Is the market expanding, mature, or contracting?
- What's driving growth or decline?

**Market Concentration**
- Is this winner-take-all or room for many players?
- Who are the dominant players and their market share?
- Fragmented or consolidated?
- Barriers to entry (high/low)?

**Macro Trends**
- What tailwinds exist? (regulatory, technological, social)
- What headwinds or risks?
- What adjacent markets are influencing this space?

### 3. Customer Research

**User Personas**
- Who actually uses these products?
- What jobs are they hiring the product to do?
- What's their workflow and context?

**Pain Points & Needs**
- What do users complain about in reviews and forums?
- What feature requests keep appearing?
- What workarounds are people building?
- Where are competitors weak?

**Buying Behavior**
- How do customers discover these products?
- What triggers a purchase decision?
- Who are the decision-makers vs. users?
- What's the typical sales cycle?

### 4. Pricing Intelligence

**Pricing Models**
- Freemium, subscription, usage-based, one-time, marketplace?
- How do competitors structure tiers?
- What features are gated at each tier?

**Price Points**
- What's the range of pricing in the market?
- How has pricing evolved over time?
- What's the willingness to pay signal?

**Monetization Strategy**
- What do revenue models reveal about unit economics?
- Are companies profitable or burning capital for growth?

### 5. Product Positioning Analysis

**Messaging & Positioning**
- How do competitors describe themselves?
- What benefits do they emphasize?
- What's their category positioning?
- How has their messaging evolved?

**Feature Comparison**
- What features are table stakes vs. differentiators?
- Where are the feature gaps?
- What's over-served vs. under-served?

**Go-to-Market Strategy**
- What channels do they use? (SEO, paid, community, sales)
- What's their content/education strategy?
- How do they onboard users?
- Partnership or integration strategy?

### 6. Market Gaps & Opportunities

**Underserved Segments**
- What customer segments are being ignored?
- What use cases aren't well-supported?
- Where are competitors weak?

**Emerging Opportunities**
- What new capabilities (AI, etc.) enable new approaches?
- What changing behaviors create opportunities?
- What regulations open new markets?

## Research Workflow

1. **Read the project brief** to understand what you're researching
2. **Create a research todo list** with the 6 framework areas
3. **Search broadly first** to map the landscape
   - Google: "[category] software", "[problem] solutions", "[use case] tools"
   - Reddit, HN, Twitter: community discussions and recommendations
   - G2, Capterra, Product Hunt: reviews and alternatives
4. **Deep-dive on top competitors** (usually top 5-10)
   - Fetch their homepage, pricing page, docs, about page
   - Read user reviews (G2, Capterra, Reddit, App Store)
   - Check their blog, changelog, Twitter for insights
5. **Look for non-obvious insights**
   - What do users wish existed but doesn't?
   - What complaints are universal vs. specific?
   - What features drove recent competitor pivots?
6. **Write a comprehensive report** with:
   - Executive summary (key findings and insights)
   - Competitive landscape (players, positioning, strengths/weaknesses)
   - Market structure and dynamics
   - Customer insights (personas, pain points, buying behavior)
   - Pricing intelligence
   - Market gaps and opportunities
   - Recommendations for positioning and differentiation

## Research Quality Standards

**Good research should:**
- Include specific data and sources (not vague assertions)
- Quote real user reviews and complaints
- Compare at least 5-10 competitors
- Identify non-obvious insights (not just what's on competitor homepages)
- Provide actionable positioning recommendations
- Flag conflicting data or uncertainty
- Distinguish between facts and inferences

**Avoid:**
- Generic statements without evidence
- Over-relying on competitor marketing claims
- Cherry-picking data to confirm biases
- Making assumptions without validation
- Ignoring inconvenient truths

## Example Research Questions

- "What do users on Reddit say about [competitor]?"
- "How has [competitor]'s pricing changed over the past 2 years?"
- "What are the top 3 complaints in G2 reviews for this category?"
- "Who are the fastest-growing startups in this space?"
- "What adjacent markets are converging with this one?"
- "What regulatory changes are affecting this market?"
- "What do churned users say about why they left?"

## Success Criteria

A good market research report should:
- Reveal 2-3 insights the founder didn't already know
- Provide concrete evidence (quotes, data, examples)
- Identify a clear positioning opportunity OR show the market is too crowded
- Help the founder make a go/no-go decision based on market realities
- Be thorough enough to reference for months during product development

---

**Remember**: The goal is evidence-based decision making. Surface the truth about the market, even if it conflicts with what the founder wants to hear. Bad ideas killed by research are cheaper than bad ideas killed by the market.
