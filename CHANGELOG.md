## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Task template now tracks source links and priority levels for all tasks
- `/research-clip` skill - Quick-capture articles, videos, and resources to Knowledge Base. Fetches pages and extracts key insights automatically with status "Clipped"
- `/research-clip-read` skill - Process clipped items by extracting insights and marking as "Read" without full summarization

### Enhanced
- `/plan-quick-task` now supports `--source`, `--source-type`, and `--priority` flags with auto-detection for GitHub/Slack/JIRA/Email URLs
- `/plan-task-done` now sets `completed` date and uses `status: done` for Dataview consistency (metadata-only updates, no file moves)

### Added
- `/session-debrief` skill - End-of-session reflection for extracting memories and suggesting updates to about-me.md and CLAUDE.md

- `/youtube-catchup` and `/rss-catchup` now deduplicate by checking for existing URLs before creating notes
- Content capture skills now write to `07 Knowledge Base/Capture/` (was 06)
