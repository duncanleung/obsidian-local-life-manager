TASK SCOPING: One TASK = One spec requirement line item

A TASK should be:
- Atomic: implements exactly one requirement
- Shippable: can be pushed to main independently
- Clear: updates one ⏳ → ✅ marker when complete

DON'T: "Implement Authentication" (too broad)
DO: "User registration endpoint" (one requirement)
